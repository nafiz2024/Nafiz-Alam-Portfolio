    "I started learning programming by following my curiosity around how websites feel fast, expressive, and easy to use. That curiosity turned into a habit of building small ideas, breaking them, and rebuilding them with more care each time.",
    "The kind of work I enjoy most sits at the intersection of design and engineering: interfaces that feel smooth, thoughtful systems behind the UI, and projects where details like spacing, copy, and states matter just as much as the logic.",
    "Outside of programming, this placeholder section leaves room for the parts of you that make the portfolio human. You might talk about sports, sketching, gaming, reading, or the way you recharge after deep work and bring that energy back into your projects.",
